This is repository for one of my blog post on LogRocket. Once it is published by LogRocket team, I will post it's link here.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn OR npm install` command to download and install all Webpack dependencies.
3. Run `yarn serve` to run the server on `http://localhost:8080`. This command will run the project in development mode.
4. To build the project for production run `yarn build:prod OR npm run build:prod` command. This will build the app for production and put all the files in `/dist` folder.
5. To run production ready version on local environment, run `yarn serve:prod OR npm run serve:prod`. Then go to `http://localhost:8080`.
